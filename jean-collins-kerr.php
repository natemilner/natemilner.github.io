				<h2>Exploring the Piazza dell&rsquo;Arte: Jean Collins Kerr</h2>
			</div>
			<p>In our continuing series exploring the lives and works of the artists featured on the Piazza dell’Arte at Scranton’s Courthouse Square, we will profile author and playwright Jean Collins Kerr.</p>
			<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 3px; float: left;" src="images/kerr.jpg" alt="Jean Collins Kerr" width="189" height="250" />Jean was born Bridget Jean Collins on Electric Street, Scranton, on July 10, 1922. She would go on to attend <a title="Marywood History" href="http://www.marywood.edu/Orientation/ihmconnection.stm" target="_blank">Marywood Seminary</a>. Her time at Marywood would inspire her to write the short story &#8220;When I was Queen of the May.&#8221;</p>
			<p>She graduated from Marywood College with a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree and went on to The Catholic University of America where she received her Masters. It was at The Catholic University of America that she met then-professor <a title="Walter Kerr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kerr" target="_blank">Walter Kerr</a>, a writer himself and later a Pulitzer Prize winner for his <a title="Kerr reviews" href="http://www.fashiondollclothes.com/Gene_Doll_Theater_Reviews.html" target="_blank">drama criticism</a>. She eventually married Kerr, moved into <a title="Kerr home" href="http://www.larchmontgazette.com/2003/features/20030318kerrhouse.html" target="_blank">a home in Larchmont, N.Y.</a>, and had six children.</p>
			<p>The Kerrs’ artistic collaboration began in 1949 with “Touch and Go,” written by Jean and continued with the Tony Award-winning “King of Hearts” in 1954 which Jean wrote and Walter directed during its initial run.</p>
			<p>Together, Jean and her husband Walter wrote <a title="Goldilocks" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_%28musical%29" target="_blank">Goldilocks</a>, a Broadway musical comedy about the early days of silent film that opened in 1958. Goldilocks earned five Tony nominations and two wins.</p>
			<p>The struggles involved with creating a new musical in several of her books, including her most popular book “Please Don&#8217;t Eat The Daisies,” as well as “The Snake Has All the Lines” and “Penny Candy.”</p>
			<p>“Please Don&#8217;t Eat the Daisies,” published in 1957, features humorous essays about <a title="Kerr's suburban life" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872288-1,00.html" target="_blank">suburban life and raising children</a>; it quickly became a best seller. In 1960, the book was adapted into a film starring <a title="Doris Day" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Day" target="_blank">Doris Day</a> and <a title="David Niven" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Niven" target="_blank">David Niven</a> and that film was adapted into a television series that ran from 1965-67.</p>
			<p>Jean’s success in theater would continue with her play <a title="Mary, Mary" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%2C_Mary_%28play%29" target="_blank">“Mary, Mary,”</a> which opened in 1961, ran for over 1,500 performances and held the record for the longest-running non-musical play on Broadway. In 1963, “Mary, Mary” was adapted into a film.</p>
			<p>She died in White Plains, N.Y., of pneumonia on January 5, 2003, after writing numerous best-selling books collected from her magazine essays about family life. Her final play was produced in 1980, &#8220;Lunch Hour.&#8221;</p>
			<p><strong>Spiritual Heir:</strong> Maureen McGuigan. McGuigan has not only been a prolific local playwright but, like Kerr, has dedicated herself to supporting the arts in any capacity. Through the former Northeast Theatre (now the <a title="Electric Theatre site" href="http://www.electrictheatre.org" target="_blank">Electric Theatre</a>), McGuigan contributed her “Reveries of Shanty Hill” to the “Lackawanna Rails: 100 Years of Life in the Anthracite Valley” production in the 2004-05 season. Her play “Six Women in Labor” explored the roles of women in the Northeastern Pennsylvania workforce with a focus reminiscent of Kerr. McGuigan now acts the Deputy Director of Arts and Culture for Lackawanna County. Recently helping to name the county’s <a title="Scranton Arts Council" href="http://www.electriccityr.com/scranton-arts-council" target="_blank">Council on Arts, Culture and Education</a>.</p>
